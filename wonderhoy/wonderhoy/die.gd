#why scripting so hard vruh 💔 the script wants me to say "so the gazelle thinks he can challenge the lion. how adorable. outwardly you pose as a mighty fire breathing dragon, but on the inside you are nothing but a scared, grovenling, snot nosed little rodent. if at once you do not CEASE with your insolence, your impertinence, your insubordination. i shall personally see to it that you are eviscerated form this mortal plane.
